## Goals for this Hacktober Learn React Project

* Help those who are new to open source get exposure
* Learn something practical and useful, React
* If you have any feature that you wanted to implement in your web dev projects, feel free to propose it as an issue for this Hacktober Learn React project
* If you have ideas on how to improve any of the code here, just submit a pull request :-)

## Some issues I thought of (keep appending!)

1. Create basic login component 
2. Create a nice sidebar to navigate between pages/components
3. Some CRUD dialogs
4. Basic routing
5. Connect to backend GraphQL (tbc)

## Getting started

```
git clone https://github.com/huiyie/hacktober-learn-react.git
cd hacktober-learn-react
npm install # installs required dependencies.
npm build
npm start   # launches the server on localhost.
```

If everything went as planned, the terminal should look like...  
![Screenshot of a successful npm start in terminal](references/screenshots/npm-start-terminal.png/?raw=true "Screenshot of npm start")

...and visiting the URL that appears on the terminal from a browser...  
![Screenshot of Browser upon npm start](references/screenshots/npm-start-browser.png/?raw=true "Screenshot of npm start")
